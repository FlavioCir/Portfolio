                                I am a Junior Full-Stack Developer and I have always studied advertising graphics using programs like Illustrator, Photoshop and indesign, but at the same time I was increasingly dazzled by the world of coding. After graduating from the Artistic High School Caravaggio with "graphic" studies, I wanted to change course and undertake a course of study in the field of programming.

                                <br>
                                To get into the world of programming I decided to take a 6-month intensive course at Epicode that gave me the chance to become a Full-Stack Developer. I have a solid knowledge base in: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, typescript, Angular, Bootstrap, SASS, Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL and Postman. I am currently looking for opportunities to grow, develop and consolidate my skills in this field.

                                I am a proactive and flexible person who can work both in a group and independently. And I am always ready to face new and increasingly difficult challenges, but above all always ready to share my knowledge with others.
